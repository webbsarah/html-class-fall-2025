    <h3> Let's start with the basics! </h3>

<h2> Roast </h2>

<h3> Dark </h3>
    <p> Dark roast has the richest flavor, with the least acidity. </p>
<h3> Medium </h3>
    <p> Medium Roasts have a balanced mix of the original characteristics of the bean as well as the roasted flavor.  </p>
<h3> Light </h3>
    <p> Light roasts have an acidic flavor with lots of fruity, nutty, or floral notes depending on the flavor of the original bean.  </p>

<h2> Sweetness Scale </h3>

<h3> Very Sweet </h3>

    <p> Additives like sugar, milk, syrup, or even honey 
        can add flavor and sweeten the taste of the coffee. </p>

<h3> Very Bitter </h3>

    <p> Neglecting to add sweeteners to your coffee
        will give a raw, very bitter flavor that some tend
        to prefer. This will let the original flavor profile of the 
        bean shine through, so make sure to pick a good roast first!  </p>

<h2> Heat Preference </h3>

<h3> Hot </h3>

    <p> Hot coffee, utilizing steamed or frothed milk, will provide a cozy drink to warm the soul. 
        It might enhance the creaminess of the drink, but don't burn your tongue!
    </p>

<h3> Iced </h3>

    <p> Pouring your coffee into a cup full of ice and using cold milk (or milk alternative) 
        will grant you a refreshing, cold drink that lets the sweetness shine through! 
    </p>
